# TensorFlow Tutorial for Time Series Prediction

This tutorial is designed to easily learn TensorFlow for time series prediction. 
Each tutorial subject includes both code and notebook with descriptions.

## Tutorial Index

#### MNIST classification using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
- Classification for MNIST using RNN ([notebook](https://github.com/tgjeon/TensorFlow-Tutorials-for-Time-Series/blob/master/mnist-rnn.ipynb))

#### Time series prediction using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

- Prediction for sine wave function using Gaussian process ([code](https://github.com/tgjeon/TensorFlow-Tutorials-for-Time-Series/blob/master/gp-for-sine-wave.py) / [notebook](https://github.com/tgjeon/TensorFlow-Tutorials-for-Time-Series/blob/master/gp-for-sine-wave.ipynb))
- Prediction for sine wave function using RNN ([code](https://github.com/tgjeon/TensorFlow-Tutorials-for-Time-Series/blob/master/lstm-for-sine-wave.py) / [notebook](https://github.com/tgjeon/TensorFlow-Tutorials-for-Time-Series/blob/master/lstm-for-sine-wave.ipynb))
- Prediction for electricity price ([code](https://github.com/tgjeon/TensorFlow-Tutorials-for-Time-Series/blob/master/lstm-for-epf.py) / notebook)

- [Slides on github (KSC 2016 Tutorial)](https://github.com/tgjeon/TensorFlow-Tutorials-for-Time-Series/raw/master/KSC2016%20-%20Recurrent%20Neural%20Networks.pptx)

#### Dependencies

```
Python (3.4.4)
TensorFlow (r0.9)
numpy (1.11.1)
pandas (0.16.2)
cuda (to run examples on GPU)
```

#### Dataset

- Energy Price Forecast 2016: http://complatt.smartwatt.net
- Or use the uploaded csv file for price history for 2015.

#### Current issues

- ```tf:split_squeeze``` is deprecated and will be removed after 2016-08-01. Use ```tf.unpack``` instead.
- ```tf:dnn``` is deprecated and will be removed after 2016-08-01. Use ```tf.contrib.layers.stack``` instead.

Now I am working on modifying previous source code for tensorflow ver. 0.10.0rc0.

#### Notice
- I have received many request for revising the code for the current tensorflow version.
- I will provide summarized presentation file for the theory of time series prediction.
- And How to apply the tensorflow implementation for kaggle competitions.
- Target implementation will be tensorflow v1.2
