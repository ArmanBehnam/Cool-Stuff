# Multi-step forecasting with convolutional neural network

The hyperparameters of convolutional neural network are tuned using Hyperdrive, a feature of Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) service. To run this code, open and run the [hyperparameter_tuning.ipynb](../hyperparameter_tuning.ipynb) notebook, and specify [cnn_config.json](../cnn_config.json) as the configuration file.
