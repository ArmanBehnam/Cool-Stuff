# Multi-step forecasting with encoder-decoder network and teacher forcing

The hyperparameters of teacher forcing recurrent neural network are tuned using Hyperdrive, a feature of Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) service. To run this code, open and run the [hyperparameter_tuning.ipynb](../hyperparameter_tuning.ipynb) notebook, and specify [rnn_teacher_forcing_config.json](../rnn_teacher_forcing_config.json) as the configuration file.
