    "Python on Mac OS X has traditionally been a bit of a struggle, dealing with paths etc. to make sure the built-in Python (out of date) doesn't conflict with the Python I want to use (e.g. from Homebrew). Further complicating this, I had at various points installed Enthought EPD and Enthought Canopy. I'd like the state of Python on my computer to be less haphazard. To make that happen, I need to uninstall all Enthought products, and get everything cleaned out with respect to Homebrew, Xcode, and Virtualenv.\n",

The next guess is to use ```sudo```, but homebrew doesn't like using sudo. Ultimately, I used ```brew link --overwrite --dry-run libpng``` to identify the files that needed to be overwritten, ```chown```-ed them, performed the linking, and then ```chown```-ed them back to root. I doubt this was the best solution, but it worked.\n",
