# dInvest
Repository for distributed autonomous investment banking based on [Zipline](https://github.com/quantopian/zipline) and the [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) blockchain. Selecting a suitable financial investment, ethical and social criteria are becoming critical success factors.
The core issue is finding a suitable framework for sustainable and profitable investment in combination with full transparency over the decision process and transactions. We are working on a proof-of-concept to realize profitable, transparent and socially responsible investment.
The project is structured in two parts.
- solidity: The smart contracts that are deployed in the Ethereum blockchain (currently testnet only).
- trading: Trading algorithms based on zipline and integration with the smart contract.

This project is a work in progress.

## ToDo
- Include investment agents to Ethereum
- Experiment with ML based investment algorithms (potentially LSTMs, RNNs, and CNNs)
