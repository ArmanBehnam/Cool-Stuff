> Code and instructions for techniques to creating, visualizing, and interpreting customer segments.

In this repo, you will find the code and instructions for [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/cluster-analysis-create-visualize-and-interpret-customer-segments-474e55d00ebb?source=friends_link&sk=822ed9b7a313062378f56182991a1c3b). It is advised to read through the article whilst coding along using the **Customer Segmentation.ipynb** notebook. 

This repo and the corresponding article decribe several techniques for clustering, visualizing and interpreting clustering algorithms and output.
I explored k-Means and DBSCAN as clustering algorithms, t-SNE and PCA for dimensionality reduction, and applied
a variance technique and feature importance to select variables that uniquely represent clusters.
